It is developed on <a        href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/adrminer/"        target="_top">R-Forge</a>      by Youness Eragaibi and Ismaïl Ahmed and will be officially released on <a        href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>      periodically.</p>    <p>Currently under development, this package will likely replace the PhViD      package. Great efforts are made to re-think the structure of the objects      that are manipulated. In particular, ADRminer will handle individual      spontaneous reports make it thus possible to conduct stratified analyses      according to several covariates. From a more technical point of view,      objects are of class S4 and relies on the sparse matrix representation      (Matrix) in order to save as much as random access memory as possible. </p>    <br>    Maintainer: Ismaïl Ahmed (ismail.ahmed@inserm.fr)<br>    Developper: Youness Ergaibi and Ismaïl Ahmed<br>    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>  </body></html>
