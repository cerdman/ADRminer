ADRminer
========
ADRminer is an R package dedicated to the automated generation of drug safety signals from spontaneous reporting databases. Currently under development, this package will likely replace the PhViD package hosted on the CRAN. 
ADRminer handles individual spontaneous reports which allows to perform stratified analyses with the GPS method. A Lasso based strategy is also implemented.
