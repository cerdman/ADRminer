ADRminer
========
Adverse Drug event Reporting systems miner. ADRminer is an R package dedicated to the automated generation of drug safety signals from spontaneous reporting databases. Currently under development, this package will likely replace the PhViD package. Great efforts are made to re-think the structure of the objects that are manipulated. 
In particular, ADRminer will handle individual spontaneous reports making it thus possible to conduct stratified analyses according to several covariates.
