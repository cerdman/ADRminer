\title{ADRminer: Adverse Drug event Reporting systems miner}
\description{
  \code{ADRminer} dedicated to the automated generation of
  drug safety signals from spontaneous reporting databases.
  It is developed on R-Forge by Youness Eragaibi and Ismaïl
  Ahmed and will be officially released on CRAN
  periodically. Currently under development, this package
  will likely replace the PhViD package. Great efforts are
  being made to re-think the structure of the objects
  manipulated. In particular, ADRminer will handle
  individual spontaneous reports and thus make it possible
  to conduct stratified analyses according to several
  covariates. From a more technical point of view, objects
  manipulated (\code{\link{PvInd}} and
  \code{\link{PvCont}}) are of class S4 and rely on the
  sparse matrix representation (Matrix package) in order to
  save as much as random access memory as possible.

\details{
  For the frequentist methods, the package requires the LBE
  procedure that is stored in the Bioconductor website
  \url{http://bioconductor.org/}. LBE can be installed by
  entering
  \code{source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")}
  \code{biocLite("LBE")} in the R console.
