\description{
\code{readFAERS} makes it possible to import and convert data from the AERS into a pvInd object. Data are available on the website of the FDA. At present, we only consider initial report (I_F_COD==I). We also keep only data for which drugs do not correspond to a valid trade name (VAL_VBM==1)
