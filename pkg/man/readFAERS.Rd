\description{
\code{readFAERS} makes it possible to import and convert data from the AERS into a pvInd object. Data are available on the website of the FDA. At present, we only consider initial report (I_F_COD==I). We also keep only data for which drugs do not correspond to a valid trade name (VAL_VBM==1). For more details, please refer to the documentation provided with the FAERS files (ASC_NTS.Doc). First, we try to read the data with the \code{fread} function of the \code{data.table} package. If the latter doesn't work, the data are read with the \code{read.table} function. At present, the cleaning process for the age covariate is a bit drastic: all value < 0 are considered as NA, value associated with missing AGE_COD are considered as NA and ages entered in second are also considered as missing. Then the age value is converted into year.
