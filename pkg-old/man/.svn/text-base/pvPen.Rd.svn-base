\title{Penalized regression detection strategy}
\usage{
  pvPen(object, cov = NULL, aeLab = "all",
    detectCriter = c("BIC", "AIC"), nlambda = 500,
    nBoot = 100, parallel = F, nCore = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{an object of class PvInd}

  \item{cov}{a character vector indicating which covariate
  have to be used in the analyses. Such variables are first
  use in a logistic regression model and the residual is
  then used as the outcome in the penalized regression}
}
\description{
  pvPen implements a detection strategy based on the use of
  the Lasso regression along with BIC type detection
  criteria. The methodology follows two main steps:
  \itemize{ \item Lasso regression (with a positive
  constraint on the regression coefficients) for a grid of
  constraint parameters \item selection on the drug
  associated with the ae of interest according to the BIC.
  } This function heavily relies on the highly efficient
  \code{glmnet} package. \code{pvPen}
